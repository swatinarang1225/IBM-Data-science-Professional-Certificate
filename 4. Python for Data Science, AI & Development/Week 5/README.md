# Data science Displayed on a Dashboard

In this assignment, you are a data scientist working at a real estate investment trust. The trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. You are tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. You will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; your job is to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions are given in the template notebook. You will use Watson Studio to perform the analysis, and share an image of your finished Jupyter notebook with a URL.

# Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying authentic data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment.

# Watson Studio

You also have the option to store the Dashboard on IBM object storage so anyone can view the Dashboard; however, you will not be marked on this aspect. The next sections will set you up with IBM object storage. You will need Watson Studio to share your results. You will be creating a project with Watson Studio. If you have already signed up for Watson Studio, you will still have to get the notebook link at the end of the section.
