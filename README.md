## What is Data Science [Course 1 of 10 in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate]
### To Access the Course: [Click Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience?specialization=ibm-data-science#enroll)
### WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
1.	Defining Data Science and What Data Scientist Do
2.	Data Science topics
3.	Data Science in business
### ABOUT THE COURSE
The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.

## Tools for Data Science [Course 2 of 10 in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate]

### WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
1.	Data Scientist's Toolkit
2.	Open Source Tools
3.	IBM Tools for Data Science
4.  Final Assignment: Create and Share Your Jupyter Notebook
### ABOUT THE COURSE
What are some of the most popular data science tools, how do you use them, and what are their features? In this course, you'll learn about Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, Apache Zeppelin and Data Science Experience. You will learn about what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class Labs, you will be able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala. To end the course, you will create a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience and demonstrate your proficiency preparing a notebook, writing Markdown, and sharing your work with your peers.

## Data Science Methodology [Course 3 of 10 in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate]

### ABOUT THE COURSE
Despite the recent increase in computing power and access to data over the last couple of decades, our ability to use the data within the decision making process is either lost or not maximized at all too often, we don't have a solid understanding of the questions being asked and how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand.

This course has one purpose, and that is to share a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.

Accordingly, in this course, you will learn:
    - The major steps involved in tackling a data science problem.
    - The major steps involved in practicing data science, from forming a concrete business or research problem, to collecting and analyzing data, to building a model, and understanding the feedback after model deployment.
    - How data scientists think!
 
## Python for Data Science, AI & Development [Course 4 of 10 in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate]
### To Access the Course: [Click Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/home/welcome)
### ABOUT THE COURSE
This course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of hours—no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn Python fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to demonstrate your new skills. 

By the end of this course, you’ll feel comfortable creating basic programs, working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python. You’ll gain a strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, and develop skills to help advance your career.
